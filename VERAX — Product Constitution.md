# verax verax — Product Constitution (Unified Scan Model)

**Status:** Canonical Reference
**Audience:** Core Developers, CLI Architects, Product Engineers
**Scope:** Entire Repository (Code, CLI, UX, Architecture)

---

## 0. Rule

This document is the **single, absolute source of truth** for verax verax.

Every feature, file, command, and behavior **must** align with this document.
Anything that deviates from it is considered invalid and must be removed or rewritten.

verax verax is not a collection of commands.
It is a **single guided system** with one clear purpose.

---

## 1. Core Definition (Final)

**verax verax is a system that joins a website project as if it were a real team member, understands the site from its source code, experiences it as a real user, and then truthfully reports silent user failures based on reality — not assumptions.**

verax does not test the internet.
verax understands **one website deeply**, then protects its reality.

---

## 2. User Experience Truth (Non‑Negotiable)

verax verax exposes **one primary user action only**:

> **Scan my website**

The user:

* installs verax verax
* enters the website project directory
* runs the CLI
* selects **Scan my website**

The user never chooses phases.
The user never sees internal architecture.

All complexity is internal.

---

## 3. The Internal Three‑Phase Engine (Hidden from User)

Although the user sees one action, verax internally executes **three strict phases** in sequence.

These phases are architectural law.
They are never optional.

---

### Phase 1 — Code Understanding (Developer Perspective)

verax starts **inside the website project directory**.

It behaves like a senior developer joining the team.

verax:

* reads the source code
* understands project type and structure
* discovers routes/pages
* identifies public vs internal areas
* learns what interactions are *intended* by the code

Important rules:

* No browser is allowed
* No runtime interaction
* No guessing
* No heuristics beyond code evidence

Output:

* A deterministic **Site Manifest** describing how the website is intended to work

---

### Phase 2 — Reality Observation (User Perspective)

Only after understanding the code does verax open the website.

verax now behaves like a calm, real user:

* opens pages
* clicks visible elements
* navigates naturally
* observes what actually happens

verax records **only facts**:

* URLs
* screenshots
* visible changes

Important rules:

* No detection
* No judgment
* No interpretation

Output:

* Deterministic **Observation Traces** capturing user‑visible reality

---

### Phase 3 — Truthful Comparison (Silent Failure Detection)

Only after both understanding and observation does verax evaluate.

verax compares:

* what the code says *should* happen
* with what the user *actually* experiences

A silent user failure exists **only when**:

* the code implies an outcome
* and the user sees no meaningful effect

Important rules:

* No generic rules
* No assumptions
* No global expectations

Output:

* A **Findings Report** containing only proven mismatches

---

## 4. What verax Is

verax **is**:

* a website‑specific intelligence system
* a silent user failure detector
* evidence‑based
* deterministic
* conservative by design
* honest about uncertainty

verax exists to **support human judgment**, never to replace it.

---

## 5. What verax Is Not

verax is **not**:

* a generic website tester
* a crawler that guesses intent
* an AI system
* a pass/fail judge
* a launch authority

verax never claims certainty where uncertainty exists.

---

## 6. No Artificial Intelligence in Core Logic

verax intentionally avoids AI in its core engine.

Reasons:

* AI guesses
* AI hallucinates
* AI cannot be audited

verax must always be:

* explainable
* reproducible
* accountable

AI may only be used for:

* report summarization
* grouping findings
* human‑readable explanations

AI must never detect failures.

---

## 7. Evidence Is Mandatory

Every reported finding must include:

* clear evidence
* visible proof
* contextual explanation

If evidence is weak or ambiguous:

* confidence is lowered
* or the finding is omitted entirely

False negatives are acceptable.
False positives are not.

---

## 8. Confidence Philosophy

Confidence does not mean correctness.

Confidence means **strength of observation**.

verax communicates:

* evidence completeness
* observation depth
* ambiguity presence

Confidence is earned.
It is never assumed.

---

## 9. Scope Discipline

verax is designed for:

* marketing websites
* public SaaS sites
* landing pages
* signup and pricing flows

verax is not designed for:

* internal dashboards
* authentication‑heavy systems
* complex application platforms

This focus is permanent.

---

## 10. Product Integrity Laws

1. verax must never guess intent.
2. verax must never hide uncertainty.
3. verax must never exaggerate accuracy.
4. verax must never expose internal phases to users.
5. verax must always compare code reality to user reality.

Any violation invalidates the feature.

---

## 11. Final Statement

**verax verax is not a tool that tests websites.**

It is a system that:

* joins a project like a developer
* experiences the site like a user
* and tells the truth when those realities diverge

Nothing more.
Nothing less.
