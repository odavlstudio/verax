# Vue.js Extractors

**Status**: ⚠️ ALPHA — Not production-ready

## Overview

This directory contains Vue.js-specific extractors for VERAX promise extraction.

- `vue-navigation-extractor.js` — Extracts navigation promises from Vue template code
- `vue-router-extractor.js` — Extracts route definitions from Vue Router configuration

## ⚠️ WARNING

These extractors are **not production-ready** and are provided for:

- Early exploration of Vue.js compatibility
- Feedback and testing from Vue.js users
- Research and prototyping

## Limitations

- **Untested**: No automated test coverage
- **Undocumented**: No user-facing documentation or guides
- **Unvalidated**: No demo application or validation fixtures
- **Unsupported**: May not work with all Vue versions or configurations

## Status

To use these extractors in production:

1. Add comprehensive test coverage
2. Document all supported Vue.js versions and patterns
3. Create demo application and fixtures
4. Update main extractors registry

## Future

Vue.js support may be formalized if:
- Community demand validates the need
- Maintainability burden is acceptable
- Test coverage and documentation are complete

These extractors are research artifacts only and are not supported for production use.
