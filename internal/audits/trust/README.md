# Public Trust Artifacts

ODAVL Guardian publishes example decision artifacts to show how it works in the real world.

## What These Are

These are **real examples** of how Guardian evaluates user flows.

They show:
- What happens when things **partially work**
- Where **friction points** emerge
- How decisions are made based on **human reality**, not code correctness

## Why We Publish Them

Trust requires transparency. These artifacts demonstrate:

1. **Guardian's decision semantics** — How outcomes (PASS, WARN, RISK) are determined
2. **What matters to Guardian** — User success, not test metrics
3. **How friction is measured** — Real obstacles that real users face
4. **That failures are expected** — The web is messy; Guardian acknowledges it

## What These Are NOT

- **Marketing claims** — No "production-ready" assertions
- **Performance metrics** — No speed or uptime guarantees
- **Quality scores** — No synthetic percentages
- **Perfect scenarios** — Real flows include friction and partial success

## How to Read Them

1. Read `sample-report.md` first — it's human language
2. Review `sample-decision.json` — it's the structured decision
3. Ask yourself: *Would I want to know this before my users visit?*

## Philosophy

Guardian treats your website like a real person would:
- Navigate intentionally
- Expect things to work
- Notice when they don't
- Understand that friction is a failure, not a code error

The goal is not to pass tests. The goal is to ensure reality matches what users need.
