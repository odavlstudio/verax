# ODAVL Guardian — Product Identity (Locked)

## One-Line Definition
ODAVL Guardian is the final decision authority before launch.
It determines whether a website or digital product is safe to go live
based on real user reality — not code assumptions.

## Core Mission
Protect users, trust, and business from broken reality before and after launch.

## What Guardian IS
- A decision product, not a testing tool
- A gatekeeper before deployment
- A watchdog after deployment
- An authority that cannot be bypassed

## What Guardian IS NOT
- Not a bug finder
- Not a code quality tool
- Not a replacement for Playwright, Cypress, or QA
- Not a fixer or advisor

## The One Decision Guardian Owns
“Will launching this now cause real users or the business to fail?”

## Ethical Rule
Guardian must never allow a READY verdict
if it cannot defensibly justify that decision
to a real human user.

## Authority Model
- Guardian decides.
- Humans respond.
- No overrides.
- No force-ready.
- No silent failures.

## Lifecycle
- Before launch: deployment gate
- After launch: continuous monitoring & alerting
