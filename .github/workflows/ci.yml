# CI WORKFLOW
# 
# Purpose: Automated testing, linting, and verification on every push and PR.
# Ensures code quality and Vision compliance before merge.
# 
# Triggers:
# - push to main/master
# - pull requests to main/master
#
# Guarantees:
# - Vision Compliance Tests ALWAYS run (vision-enforcement + vision-compliance)
# - Tests run on Node 18.x and 20.x
# - Tests run on Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS
# - Lint and typecheck pass
# - Release can be verified
#
# Constitutional Status: LOCKED
# Vision tests cannot be skipped or conditionally disabled.
